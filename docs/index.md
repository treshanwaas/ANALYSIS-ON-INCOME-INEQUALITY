## INTRODUCTION 
As the world becomes more global and the distribution of wealth continues to diminish, it is important to understand how the inequality of income has changed over time and space. We chose to use the World Income Inequality Database (WIID) to analyze the trends and patterns to determine whether income inequality exists in developing and developed nations alike despite the global economic growth and that the gap is diverging.
In order to validate our hypothesis, that income inequality does exist around the world, we decided to take a three pronged approach to investigate global wealth distribution over time, analyze income inequality over geographic regions as well as compare and contrast the top and bottom wealthiest populations within each country over time.
The basis of our analysis revolves around Gini coefficients calculated for each country in a specified year. The higher the value, the larger the inequality of income or wealth is and the lower the value, the lesser the inequality of income or wealth exists within that country. This can be calculated based on a few different resource types including consumption, net income and net/gross income.
In addition to the Gini coefficients, the group analyzed the share of per capita net and gross income among population among various geographic regions and subregions to demonstrate this inequality. This analysis highlights that the wealth/income controlled by the top 10% of the population in any given region is higher than the bottom 40% of the population in all areas and even greater in developing regions.
